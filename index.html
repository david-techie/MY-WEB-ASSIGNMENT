     <h4>Eplanation of HTML</h4>
     HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as cascading style sheets and scrypting languages such as java script,a programming language.
   <h4>HTML, its role in web development</h4>
   The role of HTML in web development is to provide the backbone and structure of a web page. It defines the layout and organization of content on a web page by using a ranked structure of elements. HTML tags allow developers to specify the type of content being displayed and how it should be presented.

   HTML TAG-The tag marks the starting point of an HTML document, while marks the end of the entire document.

   HEAD TAG-Just like the header of a memo, the head of an HTML document contains special information, like its title.

   BODY TAG-The body tags and define the beginning and end of the bulk of your document.
